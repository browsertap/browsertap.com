==============


The external site for BrowserTap now uses a static site generator called [Cactus](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus)

The easiest way to run, manage, deploy this site is with the companion [Cactus for Mac app](http://cactusformac.com/)

Alternatively, you should be able to run it in the CLI:

To install Cactus: 
```
sudo easy_install cactus
```

To run the site:
```
cd browsertap.com
cactus serve
```

To deploy:
```
cactus deploy
```

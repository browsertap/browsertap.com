browsertap.com
==============


The external site for BrowserTap now uses a static site generator called [Cactus](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus)

You should be able to run it in the CLI:

To install Cactus:
```
sudo easy_install cactus
```

To run the site:
```
cactus serve
```

To deploy:
```
cactus deploy
```

Note: deploy is currently disabled as I'll be deploying from Netlify instead of S3
